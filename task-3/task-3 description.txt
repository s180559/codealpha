An online code editor is a web-based application that allows users to write, edit, and 
run code directly in a web browser. It provides a convenient and accessible platform for 
developers and programmers to experiment with code, collaborate with others, and test the
ir applications without the need for installing any development tools or environments 
locally.
Here are the key components and features of an online code editor:

Code Editing: Online code editors provide a text editor interface with syntax highlightin
       auto-indentation, code suggestions, and other features to enhance the coding 
       experience.They typically support multiple programming languages and provide 
       language-specific features.
Live Preview or Output: Some online code editors include a preview pane or output area 
         where you can see the real-time results of your code execution. This is particul
         -arly useful for web development, where you can see the visual output of HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript code.

Collaboration and Sharing: Online code editors often support collaboration features,allow
           ing multiple users to work on the same code simultaneously. They may provide
           options to share the code or collaborate in real-time with others, facilitating 
           teamwork and code reviews.

Code Execution: Depending on the online code editor, you may have the ability to execute
        code directly within the editor itself. This can be useful for testing andrunning
        smaller code snippets without the need for a separate development environment.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Features: Some online code editors offer advance
      features similar to traditional desktop IDEs. These features can include code debug
      version control integration, terminal access, package management, and more.

Cloud Storage and Project Management: Many online code editors provide cloud storage 
         options where you can save and manage your projects. This allows you to access 
         your code from any device and collaborate seamlessly.
